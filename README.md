# Smart-Budget-Tracker
💰 A command-line budget tracker written in Python for managing income, expenses, savings goals, and summaries. Built with a menu-driven structure using dictionaries and file storage.

# 🧮 Smart Budget Tracker (Python Console App)

This is a simple Python-based budget tracking program that helps users manage their income, expenses, saving goals, and spending limits through a console menu. It allows multiple users to sign up, login, add transactions, and generate personalized financial summaries.

> ⚠️ This was my **first project in Python**, built to practice core programming concepts like user input handling, lists, file I/O, and basic control structures. The code is beginner-level and menu-driven.
